📄 ML-Based Text Classification (NLP)
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to text classification using classical NLP techniques.
The goal is to automatically classify short customer support messages into predefined categories.

This project is designed as a beginner-friendly NLP project to understand the end-to-end text classification pipeline.

🎯 Problem Statement

Given short customer messages, classify them into the following categories:

Delivery Issue

Payment Issue

Account Issue

Product Issue

Other

🧠 Approach Used

Text Preprocessing

Convert text to lowercase

Remove punctuation and extra spaces

Feature Extraction

Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF

Model

Train a Logistic Regression classifier

Evaluation

Evaluate performance using accuracy

Validate predictions on unseen messages

🧪 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Regular Expressions

📈 Key Learnings

ML-based text classification requires sufficient and balanced data

With small datasets, accuracy can be unstable

As data size increases, ML models generalize better than rule-based methods

Accuracy should be interpreted along with business context

⚠️ Limitations

Performance depends heavily on data size and quality

Not suitable for very small datasets

Requires labeled data
